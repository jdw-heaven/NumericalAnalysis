# The Repository are some numerical analysis codes and theories
## Now it doesn't have any theorical analysis, I'll finish them when I'm free
## This is the list of Numerical Analysis
1.my_hornor         find the value of a known polynomial

2.my_PI             interpolating polynomial

3.my_eigenvalue     Jacobi's way to get eigenvalue and eigenvector
